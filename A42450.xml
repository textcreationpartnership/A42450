            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.23.</note> call God to Record upon his Soul) that their refuſing to ſwear, is with reſpect to the Reputation of Chriſtianity, and the Evangelical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Truth and Righteouſneſs, which exceed that of the Law and the ſolemn Oaths thereof, and to the expreſs Prohibition in the Caſe.

               <head>SECT. III. <hi>An Examination of this Pretence for Refuſal of Oaths.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall not now make inquiry, whether all the Impriſonments and Sufferings of Quakers, have been only for their refuſing of Oaths exacted of them by Magiſtrates. But my buſineſs is to examine, whether their pretence of Conſcience be allowable in this Caſe, to exempt them from being preſt to Swear, or to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from the guilt of diſobedience, in their obſtinate refuſal of all Oaths whatſoever. Here, firſt I muſt lay open two things in this Diſcourſe, to wit, the foul Hypocriſie, and the falſe Doctrine of theſe Quakers, in the ground-work of their perverſeneſs. It is a matter of much conſequence, to the right underſtanding of this ſerpentine breed, to compare their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, of reſpect to the Honor of Chriſtianity, of obedience to Chriſts command, and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, with their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108366:4"/>known Principles and Practiſes, and to ſee whether there be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in them, and theſe Men bear an equal regard to all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.6.</note> and his Apoſtles, as <hi>David</hi> had a reſpect to all Gods Commandments. For partiality in keeping one command with a nice ſcrupuloſity, but breaking others with licentiouſneſs, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain token of inſincerity, and a pretence of Zeal, for one part of the Rule of Religion, when all the Rule beſide is rejected, can be taken for no other, than diveliſh diſſimulation. Now let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Quakers, in relation to other parts of Chriſtianity, be a little looked into, and you will quickly ſee, how little value, credit, or obedience, they defer to the precepts of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Do they not caſt aſide the Ordinances of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for Worſhip and Government? Do they not avowedly refuſe to give honor,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> to whom honor is commanded to be given as due? Do they not diſſolve, or weaken thoſe bonds of civil ſocieties, which Chriſt by his Goſpel hath tied ſtreighter, than the Law of Nature did? Do they not violate Chriſtian Charity, by Damning all that are not of their combination? To ſay nothing of their reviling all Miniſters of the Goſpel. Hath this Precept of not Swearing, ſwallowed up the whole Body of their Chriſtian Religion? Or ſhall the obſervance of it paſs current for univerſal, and uniform obedience, to the <hi>compleat Law of Liberty?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.25.</note> Is not then ſomething elſe in the bottome, beſides the tenderneſs of the Reputation of Chriſtianity? Let this be well thought on. But another thing is yet more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable. Who would not think, but that theſe hot Zealots for Chriſts Doctrine of the Goſpel, who ſuffer ſuch hard things, rather than break Chriſts Commandment, did make the Holy Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, which Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, have, by practice and precept, commended to our ſtudy, for the confirming of our Faith, and the regulating our Lives, and thoſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuperadded to them, joyntly to be the Foundation on which we are built up to be that Temple,
<note place="margin">Eph. 2.19.</note> whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the chief corner ſtone, or the compleat Rule of Faith, and Manners? For indeed without the Scriptures, now who can aſſuredly know what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect Will of God? And how came theſe Men to be acquainted with this very Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, but by the Scriptures? But after all this, you will find your ſelf much miſtaken, if you imagine that theſe Men make the written Oracles of God, their principle of Religion, or Rule of Life. For the heads of them, in ſeveral Books, ſet up the Light of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108366:4"/>God within them, for the only infallible Rule, and they diſparage the Holy Scriptures, which they allow to be, at the beſt, but a ſhadow of Gods will. Again their diſſimulation of what they dare not deny, to be the Word and Will of God concerning Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, together with their impious deſpiſing of the ſame Holy Word, is apparently viſible in their Sophiſtical concluſion, thus expreſt with all the ſubtilty that the old Serpent could inſpire into them, <hi>So though it</hi> (viz. <hi>Swearing</hi>) <hi>was allowed in the Law,</hi> (viz. of <hi>Moſes</hi> which is oppoſed by them in the precedent ſentence, and here to the Goſpel) <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles forbid it in his Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a double fallacy in the firſt Member of the concluſion. They would induce a conceit, that as <hi>Divorce</hi> was by God, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, permitted to the Jews,</hi> to paſs unpuniſhed,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.8. Mal. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>for the hardneſs of their hearts,</hi> which yet was not <hi>approved</hi> by God, as good in it ſelf, and therefore it is regulated by a Law for the ſecurity of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which Law doth but <hi>permit</hi> the divorce, but <hi>enjoyn</hi> the giving a Bill; ſo Swearing was but allowed barely with preſcription of forms for Solemnity, and not commanded:
<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13. &amp; 10.12.20.</note> Whereas Swearing by the Name of God was commanded, (which is devoted by the Fear of God in Scripture) as a ſolemn part of his Holy Worſhip, whereby Man gives God the Glory of his Sovereignity, Providence, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Omniſcience, Omnipotence, Veracity, Juſtice and Equity. The Prophets alſo, who reached to the depth of the Law, which was

               <p>I now proceed to animadvert the falſe Doctrine, either inſinuated ſecretly by ſuppoſition, or expreſſed openly by profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is falſly ſuppoſed, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not in any part of it concern, or oblige us Chriſtians. I ſhall hereafter ſhew that Chriſts prohibition of Swearing in familiar Diſcourſe, and St. <hi>James</hi>'s reſtraint of the Tongues outrage in paſſionate heates, is no forbidding of what the Law commands. But if the Law of Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring oblige Chriſtians, or be but a precedent to direct them, we muſt obſerve it, or at leaſt may warrantably imitate it. The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of the <hi>Law,</hi> which concerned the <hi>Typical Service</hi> and <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>the Temple,</hi> ceaſed as to the deſign and Virtue of it, when Chriſt by his Goſpel publiſhed the accompliſhment of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108366:5"/>wrought by his Death and Reſurrection. The <hi>Political Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was peculiarly accommodated, in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they were, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, made God's Tenants of <hi>Canaan, ceaſed,</hi> when they <hi>ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to be the <hi>Politick People of God.</hi> Both were openly abrogated, as to their exerciſe and practice by the utter devaſtation of the Holy City, with the Temple it ſelf, by the diſſolution of the Policy, by the ejectment of the Nation out of their Land, and diſperſion over the face of the Earth, in which ſtate of exile,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 3.4.</note> accompanied with bondage, they yet <hi>remain without King, Prince, Sacrifice, Image, Ephod, and Teraphim;</hi> that is, without any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Form of Government, and without any means to ſerve, or to conſult God, as formerly they had done. But for the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> ſo far as it preſcribes Offices, and exerciſes of Piety, Charity, Juſtice, Humanity, and Prudence; it obliges Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not upon the ſame account it did the Jews, to wit, as it was a part of the <hi>Covenant</hi> made in <hi>Horeb,</hi> but as it is a clear explication, and improvement of the Law of Nature, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particular Precepts, from general Principals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Righteouſneſs. Therefore <hi>St.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8. Eph. 6.1.2.</note> Paul</hi> charges Chriſtians with obedience to the Law, the ſecond Table whereof he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafts into the Gospel. And (which is yet more conſiderable, to manifeſt our concernment in the Law) he eſtabliſhes the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maintenance of the Miniſters, not only upon the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo upon two <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 9.8.14.</note> according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning of the one, and the Reaſon and Analogy of the other. And when we hear him ſpeak thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Doth not alſo the Law ſay theſe things?</hi> We muſt remember, that as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſays elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>We know whatſoever things the Law ſpeaks</hi> (either for <hi>conviction,</hi> or for <hi>direction</hi>) <hi>It ſpeaks unto them that are under the Law.</hi> We therefore who have and hear, by God's bounty, <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> as well as <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> are under the <hi>Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk 16.29.</note> not as a <hi>Covenant</hi> of Righteouſneſs and Life by Works, (for in this reſpect, <hi>We are not under the Law,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> but under the grace of the Goſpel</hi>) but as an obligatory <hi>Rule</hi> of obedience, to the Will of God, declared therein; therefore <hi>St. James</hi> calls the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a <hi>Perfect Law of Liberty, the doing whereof muſt be added to the hearing, if we deſire to be happy, St. James</hi> alſo calls it <hi>The Royal Law,</hi> one Commandement whereof being broken, the whole Golden Chain is broken, by which we muſt order our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108366:6"/>lives,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.25. &amp; 2.8.12.</note> and ſhall be judged. Now <hi>St. James</hi> knew, that the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment running in the <hi>Negative, Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain,</hi> did include the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precept of Swearing reverently, and keeping legitimate Oaths, which were Duties known well by the light of Nature, but reinforced upon the Jews by the Law, Now is it imaginable, that <hi>St. James</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> writing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould ſo far forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as after this high commendation of their Law, expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit what the Law enjoyned, and by a total abolition of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cancel the Third Commandment, as a thing that hath no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any place or uſe under the Goſpel? This intolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is eaſily avoided, if according to the ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, eaſily gathered from the Context, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that impatience is the Parent of raſh Oaths, we ſay, that <hi>St. James</hi> did very wiſely joyn his inhibition of Swearing in heat and haſte, upon the Sallies of Paſſion, to his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto patience;
<note place="margin">Jam. 5.8.12.</note> and yet he did not aboliſh the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, nor baniſh Oaths out of Chriſtendom. I confeſs I have unawares tranſgreſſed mine own limits, and expounded <hi>St. James</hi> before the method I preſcribed to my ſelf did require it; but I ſhall have the leſs to ſay hereafter. Indeed being inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſhew how <hi>St. James,</hi> and indeed all the Apoſtles, do oblige Chriſtians to their obſervance of, and obedience to the Law, in thoſe Precepts which concern all Nations, who are by Chriſt ſet at liberty from the Judaical Yoke of Ceremonies and carnal Ordinances, amongſt which, none was ſo mad yet, as to rank an Oath; I could not but obſerve the incongruity of the Apoſtles prohibition, as it is over-ſtretched by the Quakers, with his own honouring of the Law, and to prevent any ſcruple which might ariſe through miſunderſtanding of the Apoſtles reſtraint of us from ſwearing, by this diſtinction of imprudent and paſſionate Oaths, belched out in rage, from deliberate ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon weighty Cauſes, either arbitrarily, or out of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Authority, but always with due reverence to God, I have open'd a way to reconcile <hi>St. James</hi> to himſelf, and the Law to the Goſpel. And now I proceed,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To refute the dangerous errors of the Quakers, which they lay for a foundation of their abſtinence from ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They affirm, the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel exceeds that of the Law. This Affertion they maintain by the example of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108366:6"/>one <hi>Walter Brute,</hi> who, (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates, in his Martyrology) defended his refuſal of an Oath, becauſe his Maſter Chriſt taught Chriſtian Men, that in affirmation of a Truth, they ſhould paſs the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or elſe he excludes them out of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. To the words recited out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33.37. <hi>Walter Brute</hi> ſubjoyned; Therefore as the perfection of the antient Men of the Old Teſtament was, not to forſwear themſelves; ſo the perfection of Chriſtian Men, is not to ſwear at all, becauſe they are ſo commanded of Chriſt. But though <hi>Walter Brute</hi> was miſtaken in the ſenſe of Chriſts Commandment, yet his words mount not to ſuch an height of Error, as this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Quakers. For <hi>W. B.</hi> doth well note, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, our Righteouſneſs muſt exceed that of the Scribes and Phariſees, but not that of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And to the right underſtanding of Chriſts Sermon in the Mount; we muſt take notice that Chriſt doth not unfold to his novice Diſciples, the Myſteries of the Goſpel; but firſt corrects the Jewiſh vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar error of Happineſs, conſiſting in the full enjoyment of the Temporal Bleſſings promiſed in the Law, and prepares them for the Croſs, to be ſuffered for Righteouſneſs: and that they might not be deceived by a counterfeit or defective Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he eſtabliſhes <hi>the Law,</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then proceeds to clear and vindicate the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the corrupt Gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees, whoſe new Model of Righteouſneſs was ſo defective, that our Saviour ſaid plainly, and ſeverely; that <hi>except your Righteouſneſs exceed beyond that of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 5.20.</note> 
                  <hi>ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, ye cannot be Subjects of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which now ye long to ſee. Mark that Chriſt ſpake then to the Jews, who were carried away with a reverence and eſteem of the Scribes and Phariſees, who partly enervated, partly made void the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by their new Traditions, and falſe Interpretations. Chriſt recovers the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it was expounded by the Prophets, who preferred a Spiritual Obedience, and ſincere Righteouſneſs, and charitable Mercy before Sacrifices, from noval corruptions, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it, explain'd by himſelf, to them, who delighted to be counted the Diſciples of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He propounds no ſuperabundant Righteouſneſs beyond the Law, which cannot be exceeded in a tittle. For there is nothing imaginable in the way of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108366:7"/>(as it imports a conformity of Man's Will unto God's Will) beyond the <hi>loving of God with all the Heart, Soul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<note place="margin">Matt. 22.37.40.</note> and Strength, and the loving of our Neighbor as our ſelf, on which two Commandments all the Law and the Prophets do depend.</hi> Theſe, Chriſt came neither to make void, nor to improve by any new Precept of Righteouſneſs. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God by Faith,</hi> which is now fully and clearly revealed in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17. &amp; 3.21, 22.</note> is another thing, far different from <hi>the inherent and active Righteouſneſs,</hi> which Chriſt in his Sermon ſo earneſtly recommends to his new-come Auditors. The conceit that Chriſt made up the defects of the Law, and laid a yoke of more exact Righteouſneſs upon Chriſtians, than <hi>Moſes</hi> laid upon the Jews; (yet Papiſts ſay, we may take up, or refuſe at pleaſure, becauſe all theſe pretended additions (which we may find as eaſily in the Old Teſtament, as in the New) are not Commandments, but Counſels,) hath bred many pernicious errors and practiſes in the Church. The Popiſh way of taking Chriſts <hi>additional Ordinances</hi> (as they conceive) for <hi>Counſels</hi> leading to a ſtate of Perfection above common Chriſtians, hath begot the Doctrine of <hi>Works of Supererogation,</hi> of <hi>Merit,</hi> of <hi>Monkery,</hi> and all the Superſtitions and Frauds, depending upon them. The Phanatick way of falſe expounding Chriſts <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi> of the Old Law, for <hi>New Precepts</hi> obliging all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, hath put <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and others upon the conceit, that the uſe of the Sword in the Magiſtrates hand, and in the Soldiers, and alſo Swearing, is altogether inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity. But let it be conſidered, whether it is likely that Chriſt would engage his raw Diſciples to break the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in a refractory manner to diſobey their Magiſtrates by refuſal of Oaths, which might be exacted of them almoſt every day. Certainly if his Doctrine had been ſuch, and any number of his Diſciples, had been obedient to his new Law; his adverſaries who took much pain to little purpoſe, in ſuborning witneſſes againſt Chriſt, might, with eaſe, have found ground enough of accuſation, and plenty of Witneſſes, who heard and practiſed his Doctrine, or, in their Courts, ſaw it obſerved: (if Chriſts words had been taken at that time in the ſame ſenſe as the Quakers do now) to have overwhelmed our Saviour with the charge of abrogating <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, is it imaginable, that Chriſt our Bleſſed Lord and Maſter would ſo prevaricate, as not to obſerve, and practiſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108366:7"/>what he taught and preached to his Diſciples? But our Bleſſed Saviour, whom theſe Seducers affirm to have forbidden Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Court, at the Command of a Magiſtrate, and to have made this abſtinence from Oaths a degree of Perfection above the Righteouſneſs of the Law, did, himſelf, at the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> after long and ſtrange ſilence, give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the High Prieſt, being required to ſpeak upon his Oath; and he ſubmitted to the High Prieſt's adjuration, by confeſſing himſelf to be Chriſt. The High Prieſt (as if he would uſe a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Rack,</hi> to extort a confeſſion from his ſilent Priſoner) ſaid, <hi>I adjure thee by the living God,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24 63.</note> that thou tell us whether thou be the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> The form of the Oath is pronounced by the Judge himſelf, with the Matter inquired for. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's anſwer of aſſent, is a taking of the Oath. Thus Chriſt did, and that he taught the contrary, is contrary to Reaſon, and to the ſenſe of our Saviours Sermons, who therein ſecures the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to a <hi>Tittle,</hi> and excludes from Heaven,
<note place="margin">Matt. 5 17, 18 19,</note> any one that teaches the breach of the leaſt Commandment in the Law. Surely if his Auditors had then underſtood their new Maſter to have abrogated all the Precepts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> concerning Oaths in Judicature eſpecially, they would have accuſed him of contradicting himſelf, and of diſparaging <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the Law of God, and in that humor would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him. But it is evident that our Saviours Doctrine had a powerful Influence upon them another way,
<note place="margin">Matt. 7 28, 29.</note> to raiſe their Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Reverence of his Authority, above that of the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
               <p>But the knotty queſtion is not yet untied. For it is ſaid by many, If our Saviour did not <hi>fill up</hi> (as they expound <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the <hi>Defects,</hi> or the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> of the Law, in points of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; why doth he oppoſe <hi>his ſayings, to what was ſaid of old in the Law,</hi> and ſettle a new Rule of Righteouſneſs? Here lies the difficulty, which I pray God direct me to clear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, that the common expoſition of the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by fulfilling, (as the Evangeliſt uſes it,
<note place="margin">Matt. 3.15.</note> when he relates our Bleſſed Saviours Speech, wherewith he ſatisfied <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> concerning Baptizing his Maſter; <hi>Thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs</hi>) is very pertinent and appoſite, to the former mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Sentence, as much as 'tis agreeable to the Truth. For Chriſt that came <hi>to deſtroy the works of the Devil,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.6.5.</note> and to take away ſin, which is the breach of the Law;</hi> by his Holy Life and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108366:8"/>Doctrine, and by his expiatory Sacrifice, might truly and fitly ſay, he came not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Law and the Prophets, but to <hi>fulfil</hi> them. And to reject this Senſe of Chriſts words, without manifeſting the incongruity of it, is an injurious dealing with Scripture. On the other ſide, the expounding of it <hi>Filling up,</hi> or <hi>Supplying,</hi> is ſuppoſed to be true, before it is proved; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is not ſo agreeable to the oppoſition ſet between <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Certainly, <hi>Filling up by Addition</hi> is not ſo directly oppoſite to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the Law and Prophets, as <hi>Fulfilling them</hi> is, which ſtrengthens their Authority and Credit. But let theſe Men, who are ſo earneſt for Chriſts improvement of the Law, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of more excellent Precepts of exact Purity, and heroick Patience, ſhew how he hath ſupplied the defects of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; ſince <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> and the Prophets, have in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places given the ſame Rules of Purity, Peace, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Apoſtles have enforced their exhortations to theſe Chriſtian Vertues, by teſtimonies taken out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as any one that is indifferently verſed in the Apoſtolical Epiſtles will find.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this pretended filling up of the Law, makes the new Doctrine of Chriſt, indeed to be the inſerting a piece of a new and unwrought Cloth into an old Garment,
<note place="margin">Matt. 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>6.</note> which agrees not with it, but makes the rent worſe. For if the ſuperſtructure, which theſe expoſitors build upon their fancied foundation, be true, Chriſt came to deſtroy the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets as unſufficient for Chriſtians, and for the Jews too at that time, by requiring a Righteouſneſs more accurate, then they did. For if Chriſt forbad all Oaths, even thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it unavoidably follows, that the great Prophet Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets injoyned, and he diſſolved their building, which is a ſtrange way of perfecting, and Chriſt for his part, ſtrongly diſavows to have been the intent of his coming.

                  </note> as our Saviour more largely elſewhere handles the caſe. It is beſides my preſent purpoſe to enter upon another queſtion, beſides that of Oaths: I ſhall only ſay, that our Bleſſed Saviour intended a reformation of the Jewiſh Nation, corrupt by cuſtom, and the reſtitution of Marriage, throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to its Integrity, and Dignity; and to prefer God's <hi>Primitive
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108366:8"/>Ordinance</hi> before <hi>a political Law;</hi> attempered by a wiſe and a Gracious Law-giver, to the humour of an ill-natured people.

But it ſounds harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when a Man ſays, This Law is <hi>filled up</hi> by Chriſt, when he <hi>diſſwades the uſe of the Law.</hi> By the way take notice, that many Political Laws were wiſely contrived, and provided, by God, for the Jewiſh People, as fit remedies of many evils emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent by the naughty diſpoſition of a froward Generation, which Proviſions were left to the liberty of the offended Party to make uſe of. Now Chriſts prudential admonitions of the Jews, not to fly to thoſe Remedies, are no abrogations of thoſe Laws. But I have ſaid enough of Chriſts preſerving reverence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning obedience to that original Rule of Righteouſneſs, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Mankind, which was antienter than the Law, given in Mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> and is ſet down and explain'd in the Law, and in the Prophets, which compleat the Body of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Teſtament, which God hath thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to preſerve, for the benefit of his Church Univerſal of all Nations.</p>
               <p>Finally, to ſolve the whole objection, the Adverſaries and their Doctrine, againſt which, Chriſt bends his Diſcourſe, are to be enquired for, and diſcovered. Chriſt, before he delivered his own Senſe and Saying, premiſes this to his preſent Auditors, <hi>Ye have heard, that it was ſaid to, or by them of old time, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 5.21.27.23. <hi>ver.</hi> 38.43. <hi>ver.</hi> 31.</note> Or, <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Or barely, <hi>It hath been ſaid.</hi> Now that which was ſaid to them of old time (<hi>viz.</hi> to the Anceſtors of the Jews, that either heard God himſelf, or <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets) which is recited and interpreted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, is either ſome words of the Decalogue, <hi>viz.</hi> the 6.7, and 3 Commandments; or elſe ſome Precepts in the Law, as thoſe concerning Divorce, Retaliation, Love and Hatred; but of whom did that people hear it? without doubt, of the <hi>Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 23.13, <hi>&amp;</hi> and 16.</note> whoſe form of Righteouſneſs Chriſt taxes for defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and whom elſewhere he ſharply reproves for <hi>Blind Guides,</hi> yet <hi>active</hi> and <hi>cunning Seducers;</hi> and of whoſe ſower but ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108366:9"/>Leaven of falſe Doctrine, he warns his Diſciples to beware. But did they hear all that God ſaid to them of old time, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe? Did theſe popular <hi>Rabbies</hi> preach the word of God intirely, and ſincerely, without addition, mutilation, corruption, and adulterating, by vain traditions of Men, and by fraudulent gloſſes? No ſuch matter; this is confeſſed, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, that thoſe ſoothing Preachers inſiſted on the Letter of the Law, and to gratify the corrupt affections of their Clients and Scholars, who looked on them, as bearing the Keys of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and uncontroulable interpreters of the Law, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them accordingly; perſwaded them, that an external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or abſtinence from Adultery, Murder, Perjury, was a full ſatisfaction to the Law, and this <hi>patch of innocency</hi> was an <hi>entire raiment of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Further, They gave all the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Peoples paſſions of Luſt and Revenge, which the politick Law did not reach at to puniſh. In the mean time they neglected all the Sermons of the Prophets, who were, by their Office, Interpreters of the Law, and Preachers of Repentance, and did conſtantly require the cleaneſs of the Heart; Truth in the inward Man, and Regularity in their Affections. Now our Saviour Chriſt reflects upon the Impoſtors, and their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt comments upon the Law of God, when he expounds the ſeveral Commandments: He makes no diſtinction of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as <hi>W. Brute</hi> miſconceived) as if there were one perfection of the Men of the Old Teſtament, and another of Chriſtian Men. A ſincere endeavour to be Holy, and Merciful, as God our Heavenly Father is, and ſhews himſelf to be our pattern, is the Perfection common to both Jew and Gentile, that follow after the Righteouſneſs of God's preſcription. That which <hi>W. Brute,</hi> and theſe Quakers that follow him, call <hi>The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Antient</hi> Jews, <hi>Not to forſwear themſelves,</hi> is but the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, clipt,</hi> and <hi>counterfeit Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> expounding the 3 Commandment by halfes; <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> that is, ſaid they, <hi>Thou ſhalt no ſwear falſly, nor break thy Oath,</hi> whereas they never counted raſh and vain Oaths to be a breach of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worthy their reproval. And that which they call <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Chriſtian Men not to ſwear at all,</hi> is indeed a <hi>corruption of Religion,</hi> by depriving God of his Honour and Worſhip, and a great <hi>Defect</hi> introduced into the <hi>publick Inſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by debarring Chriſtian States of a very ſerviceable <hi>Ordinance</hi> of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108366:9"/>God. The reaſon of mine Aſſertion is this; As Chriſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſixth and ſeventh Commandment, the force of which he extends to the reſtraint of the Eye, Heart, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as well as to the Members of the Body, oppoſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what the Phariſees indulged; In like manner, in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the third Commandment, Chriſt forbids not what the Law (which he himſelf, being the <hi>Word</hi> of God, did give unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by his hand, unto the People) did Command, and Eſtabliſh, but that ſinful ſwearing in ordinary communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being grown cuſtomary (peradventure with the Leaders, as well as the following people) theſe <hi>Maſters in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> connived at, who ſought their own Glory and Profit, and never ſeriouſly conſidered the honour of God, which Chriſt ſought to advance, in all that he did and taught. And now I hope I have evinced, that Chriſt did not ſet up a <hi>new, and more perfect rule of Righteouſneſs,</hi> than what of old was given by God, and that he hath cleared it from the corruption, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it to its integrity, from the defalcation of the Scribes, and Phariſees, without addition or detraction; and without croſſing or aboliſhing his own Law, concerning reverent ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Name of God. I do not think it needful, to take notice now of the fond and ſenſeleſs Traditions of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, concerning the binding force of Oaths, which varied with them, according to the ſeveral forms of them, as they were expreſſive, either of the Name of God the Creator, or of the Creatures; and in the names of ſeveral Creatures, they defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more Virtue to ſome than to others, though the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be ridiculous, becauſe unreaſonable,
<note place="margin">Mal. 23.16.22.</note> as our Saviour hath related, and cenſured them. Our Saviour in this Prohibition of Swearing, now under debate, appears clearly to have had a reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Eye upon ſome of their frivolous niceties. But theſe are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the lines of the main matter in queſtion, and may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the Cauſe, be paſt over without any further handling. It is high time now to conclude this Section.</p>

               <p>AN <hi>Oath</hi> being the ſubject Matter of the Controverſy, the right underſtanding of it will conduce much to the ſtating, clearing, and determining the Queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conſiſtency thereof with Chriſtianity.

The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Scripture</hi> informs us abundantly, of the nature and uſe of Swearing, which is common to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> that bear the Image of God, both <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi>

                  </note> All ſwearing, (as <hi>Moſes</hi> teaches us) is <hi>binding</hi> the perſon, with a <hi>Bond,</hi> to be conſtant and true to his word that goes out of his mouth. Now God is above the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108366:10"/>of being bound by others, but yet may, and doth <hi>bind</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>by himſelf,</hi> and <hi>to himſelf primarily,</hi> and <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> by a gracious condeſcention to his <hi>Creatures.</hi> But Man who is ſubject to the power of others, may not onely bind himſelf, of his own accord, by an Oath, but may alſo, and ſometimes ought to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this ſacred Bond to be impoſed on him, and to put it on himſelf. For perſons under the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Magiſtrates, Parents. Maſters,</hi> are bound by the expreſs <hi>Law</hi> of God, to take ſuch Oaths, which, upon juſt grounds, are exacted of them; and thoſe of equal quality may, by God's <hi>Warrant,</hi> bind themſelves each to other, by interchangeable Oaths. It is ſuperfluous now to recite at large all the examples of theſe obligations recorded in Scripture, which frequently occur to the Reader, and are ſet up by God as <hi>Pillars</hi> for the direction of Travellers,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.105.</note> or (to uſe <hi>David</hi>'s words) are deſigned to be a <hi>Light</hi> to our Feet, and a <hi>Lantern</hi> to our Paths. But the Swearer, whether by his own motion, or at the command, or intreaty of another, ought to bind himſelf to nothing, but what is agreeable to Goodneſs and Juſtice. <hi>God,</hi> the Fountain and Meaſure of Goodneſs and Juſtice, <hi>can</hi> do no other; And <hi>Man</hi> made, at firſt, in the likeneſs of God, <hi>ought</hi> to do no other. Therefore the two celebrated <hi>Axiomes</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which depend one on the other, are true and fixed Rules of Conſcience. 1. An <hi>Oath</hi> ought not to be made the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> 2. An <hi>Oath</hi> taken to that purpoſe, binds to nothing but Repentance.</p>
               <p>Now that by which a perſon binds himſelf in ſwearing, is ſuitable to his own nature, or quality and condition. <hi>God,</hi> who is an <hi>independent Being,</hi> (as his <hi>Name,</hi> by which he revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> imports, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> or more conciſely,
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I am</hi>) binds himſelf by the very mention of, and reflexion upon his own <hi>indeficient,</hi> and <hi>invariable Life and Holineſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1. Heb. 6.18. 2 Tim. 13. Mal. 3 6.

But <hi>Man,</hi> who is a <hi>Creature dependent,</hi> and <hi>obnoxions</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Sovereign Lord, Lawgiver,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> binds himſelf over to the <hi>vengeance</hi> of God, if he fail in the Truth and Sincerity of his Swearing, by an open, or at leaſt an imperfect invocation of God, to be firſt a witneſs to his Aſſertion, or Ingagement, and then to be the Judge and Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if he fail of Truth and Honeſty in either. Furthermore, it is neceſſary for us, to the right underſtanding of God's
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108366:11"/>Swearing, to obſerve, what very many do not take notice of, or do not enough conſider, and therefore ſet up their reſt here, that God, when he takes an Oath, deals with Men after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men, out of a gracious condeſcention to Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that complying with Men's weakneſs, he may cure their infidelity with an <hi>Oath,</hi> as an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and a cordial ſtrengthener of <hi>Faith.</hi> Now though there be <hi>Truth</hi> in this, and I will not ſay that this Doctrine is <hi>unſound,</hi> yet I will ſay, and prove, that it is too <hi>ſhort</hi> or <hi>narrow</hi> an explication of the <hi>myſtery</hi> of God's Swearing. For the Scripture informs us, that God hath ſworn, not only to us who are mere Men, ſometimes in <hi>Mercy,</hi> as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed, for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his promiſes, and to <hi>David</hi> and others; and ſometimes in <hi>wrath,</hi> as to the incredulous and murmuring Jews, to ſhew the irreverſibility of that ſentence, whereby they were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the promiſed Land,

If this be duely weighed, we ſhall find that there is no reaſon to ſay, that Chriſt took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſwearing from Chriſtians, to advance them to a ſtate of Perfection above the Jews. But this proud affectation of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, to be above Oaths, ſurmounts the pride of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God; I will be like the moſt high.</hi>

I will conclude this diſcourſe with the Pious Meditation of <hi>Tertullian. O nos fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, quorum cauſà jurat Deus, ſed &amp; miſerrimos, ſi Deo juranti non credimus. O how happy are we, for whoſe ſake God himſelf doth ſwear? but oh the wretched miſery of us, if we do not give credit to God, when he ſwears to win our belief.</hi> But becauſe not <hi>Divine,</hi> but <hi>Humane</hi> Oaths are at preſent in queſtion, their ſpecial nature is to be examined.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108366:12"/>God is taken up on purpoſe for his Honour, in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his Preſidency, over Humane affairs. Thus it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with <hi>Adoration,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 17.</note> It is an <hi>extraordinary</hi> piece of Worſhip, not of ſo frequent uſe as <hi>Prayer</hi> is, which is enjoyned to be in a manner <hi>unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> but reſtrained to certain weighty occaſions, ſo that it is more like <hi>Phyſick</hi> than <hi>Food.</hi> And for this cauſe Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it in ordinary communication: It is not the common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Chriſtian, nor the embelliſhment of familiar diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but a Holy weapon to be taken up for the defence of Truth and Juſtice, when the ſecurity of either doth require it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the ſpecial nature of this Religious Act, an Oath is an <hi>Appeal</hi> to God with a <hi>Penalty.</hi> It is firſt, an invocation of God, to bear witneſs with us. And ſo we acknowledge God to be, <hi>videntem veri,</hi> one that ſees and knows the truth of the thing doubted of (for it is in vain to call in one for a witneſs, who knows nothing of the matter) and alſo a ſearcher of Secrets, a tryer of the Hearts, who knows our thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the conformity of our words to our Knowledge and Purpoſes; And then there goes a <hi>curſe upon our ſelves,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with our <hi>Prayer to God.</hi> There is always an imprecation of Vengeance added to the invocation of God's teſtimony, in caſe we ſpeak otherwiſe than we know, or intend. Herein we acknowledge God to be <hi>Vindicem falſi,</hi> a juſt and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Revenger of Falſhood, Deceit, and particularly of our abuſe of him, by drawing him down to countenance our lies and fraud. Theſe things are ſo cleer, that I need not enlarge my Lecture upon the proof of them. But theſe evident Truths I lay now as the premiſes, out of which I ſhall anon draw my concluſion.</p>
               <p>And that will the eaſier obtain credit, if to the <hi>nature</hi> of an Oath, we briefly recollect the <hi>Ends, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> of an Oath, which are indeed too many to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly recounted, and unfolded at this time. The main ends of ſwearing are two, 1. The <hi>Glory of God,</hi> which naturally reſults
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108366:12"/>from Man's ſerious acknowledgements of God's Sovereignty, and all thoſe excellencies which are requiſite to ſuch a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Judge, as we make our Appeal to, whenſoever we ſwear in ſobriety. 2. The <hi>good</hi> of others, or our ſelves, which we are bound to procure, and promote. For it is deſigned as a means, 1. To cleer the Truth, and to preſerve the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men, charged unjuſtly. 2. To diſcover Crimes,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> that evil may be taken away from a ſociety. 3. To put an end to Controverſies. 4. For the firmer binding of Contracts. In many caſes, all other means of giving ſatisfaction to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ineffectual in matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the requiring and taking of an Oath, may have a good effect to procure Quiet, Peace, and Juſtice. I need ſay no more; and what I have ſaid, is warranted by the Law of God, and the good cuſtoms of the Nations, which are not only recorded, but approved by God in Scripture. It is therefore perverſly done, by thoſe Fanaticks, (whereof the Anabaptiſts are a part,) who do maintain, in ſhew at leaſt, the Holy Scriptures to be a Rule of Faith and Life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Authority againſt the Quakers, to refuſe deliberate Oaths, which are ſo frequently commanded,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.1, 4. &amp; 63.11.</note> and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scriptures; becauſe Chriſt in one place, reſtrains Men from raſh, light, and vain Oaths, which are very near a kin to perjury, and becauſe one Apoſtle forbids haſty Swearing in fits of impatience, which make Men unfit, even for <hi>Prayer,</hi> much more for <hi>Swearing.</hi> For that <hi>St. James</hi> meant no more,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> it is manifeſt, becauſe another Apoſtle, who was led by the ſame <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> (and that <hi>Spirit</hi> never contradicts himſelf) doth in his Divinely-inſpired Epiſtles, pretty fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make uſe of an Oath upon ſeveral weighty occaſions,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.23. 1 Cor. 15.31. Gal. 1.20. 1 Theſſ, 2, 5, 10. Rom. 9, 1.</note> whereof one was the vindication of his own reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the credit of his Apoſtleſhip, and the ſucceſs of his Miniſtry, did, in a good meaſure, depend upon it. And the ſame Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> charges others by Oath, to perform their Duty, or what he thought expedient for the publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Churches. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.27. This laſt inſtance, wherein <hi>St. Paul</hi> adjures the Chriſtians of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> is a paralel for Words, and for the power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of an Oath, with the High Prieſt's adjuration of Chriſt himſelf before-mentioned. Let now the Anabaptiſts find a more commodious way of reconciling the Apoſtles in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108366:13"/>this matter, if they can, than this, which we offer, ſaying, The Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus, preached by his Apoſtles, forbids temerarious ſwearing in anger, by Heaven, or Earth, or in any other form of an Oath, unto which Men were then accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who were wont to expreſs their Oath by a Creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing, or ſparing the name of God (for this is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, <hi>Nor any other Oath,</hi> which theſe Men vainly urge for their cauſe) but at the ſame time the Goſpel allows ſwearing by God, or by the Lord, upon grave and important occaſions, with judgement; and alſo, charging inferiors, under an Oath, to do their Duty. But the Quakers are no leſs, if not more irrational, then the former; for they do not deny the Scriptures, which Jews for the Old Teſtament, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the Old and New Teſtament, acknowledge to be written by Divine Inſpiration, to be <hi>True;</hi> but they fondly affirm, that nothing is the <hi>Rule of Humane Life,</hi> but the <hi>Light of God within us.</hi> We deny not the Light of God within us, to be the Director of us, but acknowledge that God, who commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Houſe the Church, (which was larger, or leſſer, as he ſaw good, to proportion the frame of it, under ſeveral diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Grace) with his <hi>Word,</hi> both outwardly publiſhed, and inwardly applyed,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4, 6.</note> and by both ways doth ſhine in our Hearts. And we further affirm, That ſince God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his living and lightſome <hi>Oracles</hi> to <hi>Writing,</hi> and the Churches cuſtody, as a <hi>Standard,</hi> whereby we may try the <hi>Spirits,</hi> whether they are of God, the <hi>Father of Lights;</hi> or of the <hi>Prince of darkneſs,</hi> who doth frequently <hi>transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> that he may with falſe Light de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and ſecure Men into his Kingdom of Darkneſs; nothing ought to be accepted, attended, and followed, as the Light of God <hi>within</hi> us, but what is agreeable to the Light of God <hi>without us,</hi> and ſhines in the <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> that is the <hi>Church,</hi> which Chriſt hath ſet up to bear the Light.</p>
               <p>To come cloſe then to the purpoſe, is it not a perverſeneſs and giddineſs of Spirit in theſe Men, to allow the Truth of the New Teſtament, which commends the Holy Scriptures of the Old, as directors of us in all thoſe Duties to God and Man, which concern all Nations, whom God would have come to the knowledge of the Truth, and yet to condemn them who direct their actions, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in taking Oaths, by this Rule? Again, ſince the Light of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108366:13"/>God within us, is, (as they acknowledge) <hi>an infallible Rule,</hi> and we, in Swearing deliberately, do follow that Light of God, which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Hearts of all Nations, as well as of the Patriarchs, and of Gods Servants, both before, and after the ſeparation of the Jews from the wide World, to be Gods choſen, and peculiar people, and of the Prophets, and of the Apoſtles, and the practice of theſe Men agreeable to Gods revealed word and will, ſhews that the Light of Conſcience, which directed and moved the Nations to Swear, was no other than the Candle of the Lord; is it not a prodigious obſtinancy in this froward Generation, not to entertain this light, but to condemn all thoſe that do receive it and walk by it? Till then the Quakers can and do by ſome evidence, as clear, as that is for which we receive and ſubmit unto the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures, manifeſt that this pretended Light within them, which is directly oppoſite to the Light which hitherto hath enlightened all the World, which did not extinguiſh it by Atheiſm, or wink againſt it with wilful folly, is of God, we cannot but conclude, that the uſe of Oaths is ſtill as warrantable, from the very Nature and benefit of them, as ever it was. And as the <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> which, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>common Notions</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>natural principles</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> yet by Satans malicious ſubtilty, and the vanity of Mans mind, are <hi>ingrafted</hi> upon the <hi>ſtock</hi> of natural Religion, do not extirpate the <hi>root</hi> of natural Religion, which will maintain true Piety to Gods Glory, when by good husbandry the corrupt grafts are cut off, and the root and branch are cultivated aright for the ſervice of the true God; ſo the various abuſes of Oaths, frequent in all Ages, with prophane deſpiſers of God, and by vicious cuſtom too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with Profeſſors of Religion, do not in themſelves directly, and ſhould not, by conſequence, eliminate the religious practice of Swearing. For the baniſhment of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as the Latines call an Oath, out of humane Society, is a ſtep to ſuperſede all Worſhip of God, and to remove an Oath out of all procedures of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is no little artifice to extinguiſh the fear of God in the World.</p>

And now I come to mine Argument, which I ſhall frame out of theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Soveraign Magiſtrate,</hi> and thoſe who are ſent by him, according to the <hi>Evangelical Doctrine,</hi> have received in their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordination,</hi> a power to uſe all means, that either by <hi>Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> are, or in <hi>common prudence</hi> ſeem, to the Wiſdom of the State,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108366:16"/>directly conducible to the preſervation of the Peace, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteouſneſs; and for puniſhment of Offenders: all which indeed is the <hi>publick good,</hi> and for the procuring whereof, God hath armed his <hi>Deputies</hi> with a <hi>Sword,</hi> or a <hi>coercive power,</hi> that the <hi>fear</hi> or the <hi>feeling</hi> of it, may conſtrain Men to obedience. All this is written with a <hi>Sun-beam</hi> in the New Teſtament. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is further confirmed, by what I have already produced to ſhew, that the Goſpel takes no <hi>flower</hi> out of the <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> though they were <hi>infidels,</hi> much leſs if they be <hi>faithful.</hi> For if St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Logick be good, that <hi>Servants</hi> being made Chriſtians ought the rather to <hi>ſerve</hi> their <hi>Maſters</hi> being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>believers,</hi> and <hi>beloved;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.2.</note> we may by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion conclude, that the Magiſtrates <hi>embracement</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> doth not <hi>impair</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> and ought not to diminiſh the Subjects <hi>inclination to ſerve and obey,</hi> and is an <hi>indeerment</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> to his <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An Oath ſeaſonably adminiſtred, and duely taken, is a fit means to preſerve Peace, by a firm obligation of Subjects to their Soveraign, (whereof we have an example, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.17.) and to ſecure and promote Juſtice, and to carry on judicial proceedings, in diſcovery of right and wrong, and in conviction of Offenders. To prove this, I need ſay no more, than adviſe any doubter, to look upon the judgment and practice of all poliſhed Nations under the Sun, ſince the Foundations of Kingdomes and Republicks in the World. And if all that be counted but a general <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> like the general Idolatry of the Nations eſtranged from God, let him remember, that the uſe and force of Oaths, is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other baſis, but the hearty Faith and ſincere fear of Gods power and vengeance. But I ſhall drive the Nail to the Head by Gods own Sentence, who eſtabliſhed Swearing in his own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a means proper to produce the effects aforeſaid, and tells the Jews for their credit, that their <hi>political Laws</hi> did exceed thoſe of all Nations, for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4.5.8.</note> Now the uſe of Oaths is an ingredient of very many Laws in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Magiſtrate who ſtands accomptable to Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.16.</note> 
                  <hi>who is King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> for the exerciſe of his power, in order to the ends of Governement, may and ought to require Oaths of the Subject, as the occaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſecuting the Kings Life and Honour, the preſervation of the publick Weal and Peace, the ending of Controverſies, and the execution of Juſtice, or the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108366:17"/>like, do require. Otherwiſe, he will hardly be able to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of imprudence, or of remiſneſs, in refuſing the choice and uſe of ſuch means, as God himſelf hath approved, and appointed in the courſe of Government. I think I may now upon theſe premiſes, ſafely and rationally infer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the Magiſtrate according to the Goſpel, may put his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of what Religion ſoever, to his Oath to Swear by the true God. I wave the Queſtion of requiring Jews, and Infidels to Swear upon the Goſpel, that it is by Jeſus Chriſt, whom we confeſs to be the true God, but they do not own as ſuch.</p>
               <p>I have now ſuffciently proved, (as I think, and hope that all who are both rational and impartial will apprehend) that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt doth not infringe, but confirm that power that Magiſtrates in joy'd by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> that is to ſay, by <hi>Gods general ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of humane Society throughout the World)</hi> and the Kings of Gods ſpecial anoyntment, and appointment over his people, were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with by his Statutes, to tender Oaths to their Subjects, and to require their obedience in taking them, ſuppoſing ſtill that the uſe of them be referr'd to their proper ends.
<note place="margin">See an example of an Oath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King 2.42. Rom. 13.4.</note> I have now but little to do farther for the proof, that the ſame Goſpel binds Chriſtians to take ſuch Oathes as are adminiſtred to them by their <hi>lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi> For God both in the way of <hi>Nature,</hi> and alſo in the courſe of <hi>Grace,</hi> doth nothing in <hi>vain,</hi> (and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays expreſly,) <hi>Gods Miniſter doth not carry a Sword in vain,</hi> and is as much bound to draw it for the defence of Gods honour, which is concerned in Swearing, as the <hi>ſervants</hi> of <hi>Secular Kings,</hi> are obliged to <hi>fight</hi> for the Life or Honour of their <hi>Maſter;</hi> which rule of Worldly State, Chriſt hath conſecrated by his Sentence.
<note place="margin">Joh. 18.36.</note> But the Magiſtrates pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is rendered vain and ineffectual, if the ſubject can clude his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and reſolve his commands into ſuch wind as ſhakes no Corn, by his obſtinate refuſal to ſwear. I ſhall therefore urge but one Argument to ſatisfie the Subjects Conſcience in this caſe.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1-7. Tit. 3.1. 1 Pet. 2.13.14.17.</note> taught by the Apoſtles to all Nations, lays, upon all Chriſtians, a neceſſity of ſubmiſſion, and obedience, with a readineſs to every good work, unto the ſupereminent powers and principalities of the World, and to the Adminiſtrators of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commiſſioned by them, not only for Wrath, (and yet that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ariſing from the apprehenſion of the Sword that gliters in the Magiſtrates hand is juſtified by St. <hi>Paul</hi>) but alſo out of Conſcience, (Quakers, mark that, to wit, Conſcience binds to no things but obedience, in this caſe rightly ſtated) or reverence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108366:17"/>whom <hi>Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Juſtice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8.15. Eph. 6.1</note> And this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal obedience, like that which Children owe to their Parents, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited but by one Rule, obey in all things in the Lord. It reaches to things <hi>indifferent,</hi> as the obedience of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> did,
<note place="margin">Jer. 35.8.9.10.18.19.</note> which God commended and rewarded with a Bleſſing. But Obedience to our Superiours in thoſe things, which are ſo far from being evidently repugnant to the Will and Command of the Lord, that they are conſonant to the expreſs Word of God, and agreeable to his Ordinances, is an Evangelical Duty unavoidable upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever, where there is a poſſibility of performance.</p>
               <p>If you conſult the Allegations out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and confer them together, the perſpicuity of the words will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to doubt of the truth of this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>But Swearing in the manner aforeſaid, when it is exacted by a lawful Superior, is a good Work done in the Name of the Lord, as I have abundantly proved already. Therefore ſome Swearing is not only conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, but alſo required by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It remains only for me to ſhow, for the direction and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians in ſeveral caſes of a more private concernment, that Oaths taken or given, without the interpoſition of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority, either upon a ſingle perſons own Motion of Spirit, impelled thereto by weighty conſiderations, or out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with a Neighbour, are not repugnant, but agreeable to the Rules of the Goſpel. Here I ſhall, for brevities ſake, produce but one argument, which hath <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> enough to prove my concluſion, and may lead the Reader to frame more by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion out of the Goſpel, if he pleaſe, for the fuller Conviction of the Adverſary, to ſtop his Mouth with number, if weight will not bear down his reaſon. The Goſpel doth always allow,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.21. 1 Pet. 4.11. Rom. 15.2.3. 1 Cor. 10.24. Phil. 2.4.</note> and as the importance of the matter requires, commands Chriſtians to do whatſoever doth directly, and by the nature of the act it ſelf, tend to the Glory of God, which ought to be the aim which we intend in all our deliberate actions: and in like manner to perform freely whatſoever really conduces to the good, peace, and welfare of our Neighbor, whom we are bound to love, as our ſelves, by the Law and Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But the due Swearing in many things that concern our ſelves, or for the ſatisfaction of our Brother; or for a mutual engagement to do what is agreeable to Piety, Juſtice, and Charity, doth bring Glory to the Name of God, and procures the good of our ſelves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108366:18"/>and others; And therefore is not by the Goſpel wholly baniſhed out of the converſation of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption is manifeſtly true. For it is apparent to ſence and reaſon, that when a Chriſtian calls God to witneſs, regard, judge, and revenge falſhood upon the Head and Soul of perjur'd perſons, he ſets forth the Glory of God, as much as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> or <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> or any of the former days before or under the Law did. And common experience teaches us, what ſatisfaction and benefit, we mutually give and receive by an Oath reverently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The concluſion therefore naturally flows from the premiſes, and abides firm as built upon a Rock, that Chriſtianity hath not made the Third Commandment a mere inſignificant or uſeleſs Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to us, by forbidding Oaths, which leaves no place for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of Gods Name that way, and ſtops up the paſſage againſt Piety and Impiety both together.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, that a great meaſure of <hi>Chriſtian Prudence</hi> is requiſite in the <hi>private</hi> uſe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> above what is needful in <hi>Oaths</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred <hi>by authority.</hi> For our ſubmiſſion to the wiſdom of the State enjoyned us by God, abſolves us from much of the trouble and care about the ſufficient weight in the ground of the Oath; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the whole burden of the Oath, with all the circumſtances to qualifie and legitimate the ſame, lies upon the diſcretion of the private Chriſtian, who ought to have <hi>a full aſſurance in his own Mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5.</note> of the warrantableneſs of the action. Therefore the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring uſe of private Oaths is ſafe, commendable, and comfortable. For according to St.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12. &amp; 10.23.</note>

But keeping of Oaths follows upon the ſparing uſe of them. For a Man will either not Swear, or when he doth, will Swear aright, neither will his Tongue, by cuſtome, out run his mind, neither will his Mind be overthrown, by the violence of his intemperate paſſions. This the good Mans Vertue will correct, and the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary abſtinence from Swearing, will cure the other. But Swearing aright becomes the Honour of the Gods, before given in Charge,</hi> (we muſt remember, the Heathen Philoſopher ſpeaks of God in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number,) <hi>it being bred together, and a companion of Piety. Reverence an Oath by not over freely and haſtily uſing it, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108366:19"/>you may be accuſtomed to ſwear aright, (to wit, when there is a fit and juſt occaſion) by not accuſtoming your ſelf to Swear. For Swearing aright, is no ſmall part of Piety.</hi> Thus the Philoſopher hath ſecured the Reverence due to Oaths, religiouſly taken, by abſtinence from raſh, light, vain, and cuſtomary Swearing, without baniſhing an eminent piece of Piety and Honour due to God out of the Life of Men. This one Teſtimony of <hi>Hierocles</hi> I ſhall oppoſe, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples in the Quakers Caſe, not for any eſteem I have of the perſon, but for the ſolidity of his reaſon, which gives us a precedent to reconcile the Reverence of an Oath, with abſtinence from cuſtomary, dangerous, and prophane Swearing, which is the taking of Gods Name in vain, and as much forbidden by God in the Third Commandement, as perjury, which the Scribes and Phariſees accounted to be the only crime ſtruck at by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this is all that I have at preſent to ſay to the Queſtion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawfulneſs of Oaths under Chriſtianity.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Perſons,</hi> both <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>judged,</hi> are to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. <hi>Perſons</hi> are either of a <hi>Private</hi> quality, and conſidered in that <hi>ſtate</hi> which is <hi>general</hi> to all Men: and indeed the moſt of Chriſts Auditors, and of Chriſtians in the days of the Apoſtles were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, and were ſo conſidered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſtation in privacy, in regard of the World.

            <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath given us another diſtinction of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of judging in caſes, wherein Men are allowed to judge. For, he ſays, <hi>Judge not according to the appearance,
<note place="margin">Joh. 7.24.</note> but judge righteous judgment.</hi> Here is a double charge, <hi>judge not,</hi> to wit, <hi>haſtily, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon weak grounds,</hi> of ſlight and ſuperficial ſhews; and yet <hi>judge Righteous Judgment,</hi> that is according to the <hi>Merit</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> upon <hi>clear evidence.</hi> I need ſay no more, to ſhew that this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is not to be underſtood in an unbounded ſenſe.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve the like of our Saviours inhibition,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.39. Mat. 13.38.39. 1 Pet. 5.8.9. Jam. 4.7. Heb. 12.4. Phil. 2.17. Apoc. 12.11.</note> 
               <hi>But I ſay unto you, reſiſt not Evil,</hi> which muſt be limited by the diſtinctions of the <hi>Evil</hi> to be reſiſted, and of the <hi>perſons</hi> reſiſting. For every private Chriſtian is a <hi>Souldier,</hi> who muſt ſtoutly reſiſt that <hi>Evil one,</hi> that Enemy, both of God and Man, the <hi>Devil;</hi> and Sin, which is the Work of the <hi>Devil,</hi> yea, every temptation unto Sin, is to be <hi>reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> ſometimes even unto <hi>Blood,</hi> not actively by ſhedding the blood of others, but paſſively, by ſuffering our own to be ſhed, and by willingly pouring it out as a <hi>drink-offering upon the Sacrifice of our Faith.</hi> For in the <hi>ſpiritual warfare</hi> Chriſtians are <hi>more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,</hi> when they <hi>love not their Lives unto Death itſelf.</hi> But the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> is armed with a <hi>Sword,</hi> and hath a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to reſiſt every evil work, to ſtop the courſe, and to repreſs the force of Sin in others, for the publick welfare and peace of the State. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Magiſtrate draw his Sword, to execute Juſtice, he muſt not put it up in his ſheath, and be quiet; if the Malefactor ſhall ſay, oh Sir, you muſt remember the command of our Saviour, <hi>Reſiſt not evil,</hi> and the check given to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was unſeaſonably and raſhly over-valiant, <hi>Put up thy Sword into its place,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.52.</note> for all that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> Thus the <hi>reſiſting evil,</hi> is unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable in private perſons, but neceſſary in publick officers.</p>
            <p>To cloſe up all, if it be an intollerable abuſe of the Goſpel-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions aforeſaid, to extend them to all occaſions, whereas in many caſes they are not of any force, it is equally irrational to ſtretch this negative, <hi>Swear not,</hi> to the utmoſt extent of the words, when they cannot conſiſt with that <hi>Law of God</hi> written in the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man; which is alſo eſtabliſhed by the Law written by <hi>Moſes</hi> at Gods command, and given to his own people for a <hi>Rule of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Righteouſneſs;</hi> and is farther urged by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who were ſparing in preſſing <hi>carnal Ordinances,</hi> but earneſt in exacting the <hi>everlaſting Righteouſneſs</hi> of God; and is confirmed by our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108366:22"/>
               <hi>Saviours Declaration,</hi> that he came not to abrogate any part of that Law, nor to infringe any piece of Gods Righteouſneſs, whereof an Oath, reverently taken upon a juſt occaſion, is a part. Let the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> then, if they can, ſhew a <hi>Diſparity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> why the one, concerning <hi>Judging</hi> and <hi>Reſiſting,</hi> muſt be <hi>limited,</hi> and the other, concerning <hi>Swearing,</hi> ought not, or may not, without injury to our Bleſſed Saviours Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. In the mean time I conclude in the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, with modeſty and care to decline the ſuſpicion of exerciſing <hi>a Dominion over the Faith of his Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.24. 1. Cor. 10.15.</note> referred his Doctrine to be determined by <hi>common reaſon,</hi> upon the <hi>general principles of Religion, I ſpeak as unto Men of diſcretion, judge ye what I ſay.</hi>
